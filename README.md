# HEAT SIMULATION

This program is a very simple simulation of the heat equation in a 2D spatial domain. The simulation uses a time-marching method
based on a few well-known algorithms for numerically solving PDEs. Namely:
- Finite Difference Method
- Crank-Nicholson (IP)
- Finite Element Methods (IP)
- Fourier Spectral Methods (IP)
